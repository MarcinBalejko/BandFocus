# BandFocus

Building a small social network for musicians with Node.js, Express, React, Redux & MongoDB.

## **Details**

BandFocus is a social network for musicians who want to join or create a new band, and for those who are simply trying to find other creative people to collaborate with. Users will be able to create their own profiles where they would share some information about themselves, their music preferences, instrument setups, and also show a video clip of their skills to others.
Moreover, each user will be able to make posts and leave comments on other peopleâ€™s profiles.
